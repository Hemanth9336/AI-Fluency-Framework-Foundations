--> AI Fluency means interacting with AI systems in ways that are effective, efficient, ethical and safe.
--> Three ways to interact with AI :
    1. Automation - AI does work for you following explicit instructions.
    2. Augmentation - You and the AI collaboratively work together.
    3. Agency - AI works independently on your behalf.
--> The 4D Framework (Four core competencies for AI Fluency)
    1. Delegation (To decide when and how to use AI)
       - Understand your goal and the problem that you are trying to solve.
       - Know what AI systems can and can't do well.
       - Decide how to divide the work between you and the AI.
    2. Description (To communicate clearly with AI)
       - What you want the final output to be.
       - How you want the AI to approach the task.
       - How you want the AI to behave.
    3. Discernment (To evaluate AI outputs)
       - Is the output useful and correct?
       - Is the AI taking the right approach?
       - Is the AI behaving as desired?
    4. Diligence (To use AI responsibly)
       - Ensuring accuracy and taking responsibility.
       - Honesty and transparency.
       - Ethical use and critical awareness.
--> What is generative AI? (Deep Dive)
    Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can create new content rather than just analyzing existing data.
    Three pillars that made it possible:
    1. Algorithms (Neural networks, Transformers)
    2. Data (Articles and websites, Code and multimodal content)
    3. Computation (GPUs, TPUs, etc., Computing clusters)
--> What makes generative AI powerful
    1. Processes vast information during training and learns complex patterns.
    2. Adapts to new tasks through in-context learning.
    3. Demonstrates emergent capabilities from scale.
--> Delegation:
    1. The Delegation competence is critical to effective and efficient AI use.
    2. You need to use your own expertise to decide what is worth doing and to leverage the unique strengths of both human and artificial intelligence.
--> Description:
    1. You need to do more than just write prompts.
    2. By nurturing your capacity for product, process, and performance description, you can transform AI tools from generic assistants into finely tuned thinking partners.
--> Effective prompting techniques (Deep Dive)
    Foundational prompting tips (Provide context, Offer examples, Specify output constraints, Break down complex tasks, Give the AI space to think, Define roles)
--> Discernment:
    1. Discernment evaluates how well your needs were met.
    2. A continuous loop of instruction and evaluation drives quality.
    3. Discernment ensures that our AI collaboration remains guided by human judgment.
--> Diligence:
    1. AI use should be not only effective and efficient, but also ethical and safe.
    2. Diligence reminds us that our interaction with AI comes with responsibility.
    3. We all want AI that is fair, and safe, and of benefit to our society.
    4. Our own behaviors play a key role in making this happen.
