# AI Fluency Course â€“ Overview

This repository contains notes and resources from the **AI Fluency Course**, aimed at helping learners understand how to interact with artificial intelligence in ways that are effective, efficient, ethical, and safe.

## ðŸ“Œ What is AI Fluency?

**AI Fluency** means interacting with AI systems in ways that are:
- Effective âœ…
- Efficient âœ…
- Ethical âœ…
- Safe âœ…

It emphasizes the ability to collaborate with AI while making informed decisions and maintaining responsibility.

## ðŸ“Œ Three Ways to Interact with AI

1. **Automation**  
   AI does work for you following explicit instructions.

2. **Augmentation**  
   You and AI collaboratively work together to achieve tasks.

3. **Agency**  
   AI works independently on your behalf without step-by-step guidance.

## ðŸ“Œ The 4D Framework â€“ Core Competencies for AI Fluency

### 1. Delegation â€“ *Deciding when and how to use AI*  
- Understand your goal and the problem you are trying to solve.  
- Know what AI systems can and can't do well.  
- Decide how to divide the work between you and the AI.

### 2. Description â€“ *Communicating clearly with AI*  
- Define what you want the final output to be.  
- Explain how you want the AI to approach the task.  
- Clarify how you want the AI to behave.

### 3. Discernment â€“ *Evaluating AI outputs*  
- Is the output useful and correct?  
- Is the AI taking the right approach?  
- Is the AI behaving as desired?

### 4. Diligence â€“ *Using AI responsibly*  
- Ensure accuracy and take responsibility for outcomes.  
- Practice honesty and transparency.  
- Promote ethical use and critical awareness.

## ðŸ“Œ What is Generative AI? (Deep Dive)

**Generative AI** refers to artificial intelligence systems that can create new content rather than just analyzing existing data.

### Three pillars that made generative AI possible:
1. **Algorithms** â€“ Neural networks, Transformers  
2. **Data** â€“ Articles, websites, code, multimodal content  
3. **Computation** â€“ GPUs, TPUs, computing clusters

---

## ðŸ“Œ What Makes Generative AI Powerful

1. It processes vast information during training and learns complex patterns.  
2. It adapts to new tasks through in-context learning.  
3. It demonstrates emergent capabilities from scaling model size and data.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Deep Dive â€“ Delegation

- Delegation is critical to effective and efficient AI use.  
- Use your expertise to decide what tasks are worth pursuing.  
- Leverage the unique strengths of both human and artificial intelligence.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Deep Dive â€“ Description

- Do more than just write prompts; articulate your needs precisely.  
- Product, process, and performance descriptions help transform AI tools from generic assistants into finely tuned thinking partners.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Effective Prompting Techniques

**Foundational prompting tips:**  
âœ” Provide context  
âœ” Offer examples  
âœ” Specify output constraints  
âœ” Break down complex tasks  
âœ” Give the AI space to think  
âœ” Define roles clearly

---

## ðŸ“Œ Deep Dive â€“ Discernment

- Discernment helps you evaluate how well your needs were met.  
- A continuous loop of instruction and evaluation ensures quality output.  
- Human judgment remains central in guiding AI collaboration.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Deep Dive â€“ Diligence

- AI use should be not only effective and efficient but also ethical and safe.  
- Diligence reminds us that responsibility lies with the user.  
- Fairness, safety, and societal benefit are core principles to uphold.  
- Our own behaviors directly influence how AI impacts society.

## ðŸ“Œ Final Thoughts

This course equips learners to interact thoughtfully with AI tools, balancing innovation with responsibility. Itâ€™s designed to build awareness, competence, and judgment for working with generative AI in various contexts.

Feel free to explore the resources, take notes, and apply these principles in your own AI-driven projects!
